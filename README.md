# python-api-challenge
This is one of the tough challenges I have done. Even though I had difficulties downloading some of the materials while the class 
was on going, it was also chanlleging wiriting the code. By the help of my class instructor, TA and few other colleagues in the class, I was able to reach this far. 
For ever new chalenge, I am learning something new. I nwas also able to use ChatGPT in the process of researching.
